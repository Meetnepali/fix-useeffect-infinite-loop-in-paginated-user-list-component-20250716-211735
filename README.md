# Task Overview
You are maintaining a React application for a blog platform. The PostList component displays published blog posts and allows users to toggle between a list and a grid (card) layout. There are known issues: switching to grid view does not update the UI, duplicate network requests occur when filtering or paginating posts resulting in flickering, and some rendered post cards have unstable keys, leading to improper UI updates.

# Guidance
Focus on the interaction between the layout toggle, the correct use of React keys when rendering lists, and the effect logic responsible for fetching post data. Consider how the component responds to layout changes, filter adjustments, and pagination events. Ensure that both views update properly, API calls are only made when genuinely needed, and the UI remains smooth and responsive under all filtering and pagination scenarios.

# Objectives
Ensure the post list toggles seamlessly between list and grid layouts. Each post in the grid should be uniquely and consistently identified for rendering, and API fetches should be made only when filter or pagination state truly changes, eliminating unnecessary requests and UI flicker.

# How to Verify
Switching between list and grid layouts should update the display accordingly. Filtering by author or paginating should never cause duplicate API calls, stacked loading states, or flickering. All posts in the grid view should render reliably, with no warning or remounting issues due to incorrect keys.
